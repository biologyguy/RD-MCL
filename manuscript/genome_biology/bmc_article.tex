\section*{Background and rationale}
When a gene evolves an important physiological function, purifying selection tends to maintain that function through evolutionary time \cite{Altenhoff:2012ea, Rogozin:2014fp, KryuchkovaMostacci:2016iw}. As a result, orthology (i.e., homology via speciation) has become a widely used predictor of shared gene product function among species, with considerable effort made to develop computational methods for identifying orthologs. The algorithms currently in popular use fall into two broad categories: Tree-based and graph-based clustering methods (recently reviewed by Fredj Tekaia \cite{Tekaia:2016ga}). Breifly, tree-based approaches (e.g., Ensembl Compara \cite{Vilella:2009ju}, LOFT \cite{vanderHeijden:2007bo}, and SYNERGY \cite{Wapinski:2007fa}) identify orthologous clades by estimating phylogenetic trees for a target gene family, and then attempt to reconcile those gene trees against a `known' species tree. While tree-based methods are very accurate under ideal conditions, they are very sensitive to the accuracy of the species trees they rely on, which can become a considerable source of uncertainty or error \cite{Xu:2016ek}. Alternatively, pairwise similarity graph clustering methods leverage graph theory to rapidly identify groups of related sequences from genome scale datasets. Due to the non-transitive nature of orthology (i.e., paralogs in one species can be orthologous to a single gene in another species), groupings of pure orthologs may not be possible. Instead, the term `orthogroup' has come to represent a cluster of genes desended from a common ancestor of the clade in question, which may include paralogs \cite{Wapinski:2007fa}. InParanoid \cite{OBrien:2005cy}, EggNOG \cite{Jensen:2007cc}, and OMA \cite{Roth:2009iu} are popular tools for assigning sequences to orthogroups using a `best-hit clique' approach, where closed best-hit sub-graphs are identified in the dataset. While accurate within each sub-graph, these methods tend to be overly strict in their assignment; this causes an under-representation of actual orthologous relationships among many species. Alternatively, Markov clustering (MCL) is very efficient at isolating more inclusive sub-graphs. OrthoMCL is one of the most popular MCL-based ortholog prediction methods \cite{Li:2003en}, but it is prone to placing too many in-paralogs into orthogroups (i.e., it is less precise).

For coarse-grained, genome-wide analysis, many of the tools mentioned above perform very well.

In the current study we have increased the overall resolving power of MCL-based orthogroup assignment with a number of novel enhancements, including refinement of the pairwise similarity metrics, using an optimization algorithm to dynamically select MCL parameters, recursively subdividing orthogroups, and testing putative orthogroups for best-hit cliques to maximize resolution.


\section*{Results}
The imputus for developing RD-MCL was to predict high-quality fine-grained orthogroups among sequences from a defined gene family.

\subsection*{Description of the RD-MCL algorithm and software}
Spill some ink regarding in/out paralogs \cite{Sonnhammer:2002vm,Tekaia:2016ga}.

BLAST scores (bit or e-value) have a strong length bias when calculating orthogroups \cite{Emms:2015ig}. OrthoFinder also uses a static inflation/edge similarity threashold \cite{Emms:2015ig}

\section*{Conclusions}
Can't wait to share my conclusions.

\section*{Methods}
\subsubsection*{RD-MCL fitness function}
Putative orthogroups were assigned a score based on the size and composition of the cluster, as well as the entire population of sequences available.

Let each sequence $s$ be an element of a set $T$ where all sequences come from the same taxa $j$.

$$
T_j = \{s:s \text{ is a gene in } j\}
$$

All sequences are assigned a score $S$, which is scaled against the largest set of sequences, $T^*$, to bound the minimum score at 1.

$$
T^* = T_j:|T_j| = max(|T|)
$$

$$
S_j = \frac{|T^*|}{|T_j|}
$$

Doing so gives greater weight to those species which have not experienced additional gene expansion, thus allowing greater inclusion of paralogs from those species where gene expansion has been more common.

To penalize the inclusion of paralogs in a putative orthogroup $O$, a diminishing returns algorithm was implemented. Sequences in the cluster are first sorted into the fewest number of subsets, of largest possible size, where each taxa is represented only once. This can be expressed as a matrix of size $X \times Y$, where $X$ is the total number of unique taxa and $Y$ is the largest number of sequences derived from a single taxon in the given set. Each column therefore represents a taxon and is filled from the top down with $S_j$ for each gene it contains, followed by zeros. For example:


$$
O \equiv
\begin{bmatrix}
    S_{j_1} & S_{j_2} & S_{j_3} & S_{j_4} & S_{j_5} & 0 & S_{j_7}\\
    0 & S_{j_2} & 0 & S_{j_4} & 0 & 0 & S_{j_7} \\
    0 & S_{j_2} & 0 & S_{j_4} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & S_{j_2} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Each row $Y$ is summed and modified by cofactors $\psi$ and $\gamma$. $\psi$ is proportional to the number of taxa in $Y$ relative to the total number of taxa present globaly (i.e., the length of $X$ in the above matrix), and $\gamma$ imposes exponentially diminishing returns on the score for each successive index of $Y$.

$$
\psi = \frac{|\{Y:Y \neq 0\}|}{|j|} + 1
$$

$$
\gamma = DRB^{Y_{index}}
$$

$$
S_Y = \gamma\psi\sum_{j} S_j
$$

Where:

$$
DRB = \text{Diminishing returns base}; 0 \leq DRB \leq 1
$$

The effects of altering $DRB$ are summarized in Supplemental Figure \ref{supfig:dim_rets}, and we have emperically chosen to use a value of 0.75 for all other experiments in this manuscript.

The final fitness score assigned to a putative orthogroup is thus the sum of each row score:

$$
S_O = \sum_{Y} S_Y
$$
